## Sponsors of the liszt-dev Github organization

Eventhough financial or material contributions are something I have never asked for during this project, some people yet decided to make donations. I feel honored, I am very grateful, and I look forward to give the same back to you by continuing my work. Below, you can see a list of awesome people who make all of this possible!
